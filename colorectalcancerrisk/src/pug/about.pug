	h1 About the Model and Source Code

	p The tool uses the answers about risk and preventive factors to calculate a personâ€™s absolute risk of colorectal cancer for a specific time period.

	p The model was tested in a large population and has been shown to be accurate in predicting absolute risk. 
		| Because the majority of participants in the case-control studies were non-Hispanic whites, relative risks for other racial or ethnic groups could not be estimated. 
		| Researchers have since updated the tool using SEER rates for black, Asian American/Pacific Islander, 
		| and Hispanic/Latino populations to enable the tool to be applicable for men and women in these populations. 
		| As more data becomes available, researchers will be able to test and validate the tool for these populations.

	p The 
		a(href="") risk calculator 
		| will be updated periodically as new data or research becomes available. In addition, the tool may prove useful to researchers who are designing research intervention studies.

	p The CCRAT may be updated periodically as new data or research becomes available. The algorithm was last updated in October 2014. The current software version is 1.1.
	p To project absolute colon cancer risk, according to the NCI CCRAT algorithm, download the SAS macro or Gauss file. 
		| Both have separate files for the models for men and women, useful for research purposes when one needs risk projections for an entire study population. 
		| The Gauss Program also computes 95% confidence intervals for risk projections.
